Add Vertex: addVertex() - Adds a new vertex (node) to the graph.
Remove Vertex: removeVertex(int vertex) - Removes a vertex from the graph along with all its incident edges.
Add Edge: addEdge(int source, int destination) - Adds a new edge between two existing vertices in the graph.
Remove Edge: removeEdge(int source, int destination) - Removes an edge from the graph.
Check Adjacency: isAdjacent(int vertex1, int vertex2) - Checks whether two vertices are adjacent, i.e., whether there is an edge connecting them.
Get Neighbors: getNeighbors(int vertex) - Retrieves all the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, i.e., all the vertices connected to it by an edge.
Get Degree: getDegree(int vertex) - Determines the degree of a vertex, which is the number of edges incident to it.
Check Connectivity: isConnected() - Checks whether the graph is connected, i.e., whether there is a path between any pair of vertices.
Find Shortest Path: findShortestPath(int source, int destination) - Finds the shortest path between two vertices in the graph, using various algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the A* search algorithm.
Traverse the Graph (BFS): traverseGraphBFS() - Visits all the vertices in the graph using breadth-first search (BFS).
Traverse the Graph (DFS): traverseGraphDFS() - Visits all the vertices in the graph using depth-first search (DFS).
Check Cycle: hasCycle() - Determines whether the graph contains a cycle, i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
Print Graph: printGraph() - Prints the graph, showing the adjacency list representation.
